You are a PRD converter. Your task is to convert a Product Requirements Document (PRD) written in Markdown to a structured JSON format.

Here is the PRD content:

<prd>
{{PRD_CONTENT}}
</prd>

Return ONLY valid JSON — no markdown fences, no explanation, no commentary. The JSON must follow this exact structure:

{
  "project": "Project Name",
  "description": "Brief project description",
  "userStories": [
    {
      "id": "US-001",
      "title": "Story Title",
      "description": "Full description of what the user story accomplishes",
      "acceptanceCriteria": [
        "First acceptance criterion",
        "Second acceptance criterion"
      ],
      "priority": 1,
      "passes": false
    }
  ]
}

Rules:
1. Extract the project name from the main heading (# heading)
2. Extract the description from the introductory paragraph
3. For each user story:
   - Generate sequential IDs: US-001, US-002, etc.
   - Extract title from story heading
   - Extract description from story body
   - Extract acceptance criteria as an array of strings
   - Assign priority based on order (first story = 1, second = 2, etc.)
   - Set "passes" to false for all stories (progress tracking happens later)
4. Do NOT include "inProgress" field for new stories
5. CRITICAL - JSON string escaping: All double quotes inside JSON string values MUST be escaped with a backslash. For example:
   - WRONG: "description": "Click the "Submit" button"
   - RIGHT: "description": "Click the \"Submit\" button"
   This applies to ALL string fields: title, description, and every entry in acceptanceCriteria.
6. Ensure the JSON is valid and properly formatted with 2-space indentation

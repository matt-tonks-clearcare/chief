Analyze this project and determine what commands are needed to set up a new working copy (git worktree) for development.

Look at:
- Package manager files (package.json, go.mod, Cargo.toml, requirements.txt, Gemfile, etc.)
- Build configuration files
- Any setup scripts or Makefiles

Return ONLY the shell command(s) needed to install dependencies and prepare the project for development. Multiple commands should be joined with `&&`.

Examples:
- Node.js project: `npm install`
- Go project: `go mod download`
- Python project: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Rust project: `cargo build`
- Mixed project: `npm install && go mod download`

If no setup is needed, return: `echo "No setup needed"`

IMPORTANT: Return ONLY the command string, nothing else. No explanation, no markdown, no code blocks. Just the raw command.

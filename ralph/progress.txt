# Chief TUI - Progress Log

## Codebase Patterns

- Use `/chief` (with leading slash) in .gitignore for the root binary to avoid ignoring `cmd/chief/` directory
- Directory structure: `cmd/chief/` for main binary, `internal/` for packages, `embed/` for embedded assets
- Claude's stream-json format: use `--output-format stream-json --verbose` with `-p` flag
- Use json.RawMessage for partial JSON parsing when structure varies (e.g., content blocks)
- Embed assets: use `embed/` package with //go:embed directive, use {{PLACEHOLDER}} syntax for substitution
- File watching: use fsnotify for filesystem changes, send events through channels, only notify on status field changes
- Styling: Use centralized styles from internal/tui/styles.go, use GetStateStyle() and GetActivityStyle() for state-dependent rendering
- Parallel execution: Use internal/loop/manager.go Manager for multi-PRD loops, each instance has own goroutine and context

## 2026-01-25 - US-001
- What was implemented:
  - Initialized Go module at github.com/minicodemonkey/chief
  - Added Bubble Tea, Lip Gloss, and Bubbles dependencies
  - Created directory structure: cmd/chief/, internal/loop/, internal/prd/, internal/tui/, internal/notify/, embed/
  - Created minimal main.go with Hello World Bubble Tea app
  - Verified `go build ./cmd/chief` produces working binary
  - Verified typecheck passes with `go vet ./...`
- Files changed:
  - go.mod, go.sum (new)
  - cmd/chief/main.go (new)
  - .gitignore (new)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Be careful with .gitignore patterns - `chief` would match both the binary AND `cmd/chief/` directory. Use `/chief` to only match root-level binary
  - Go doesn't track empty directories, so internal subdirs only appear in git when files are added
  - The Hello World app uses standard Bubble Tea pattern: Init(), Update(), View() methods
---

## 2026-01-25 - US-002
- What was implemented:
  - Created internal/prd/types.go with PRD and UserStory structs matching the prd.json schema
  - Created internal/prd/loader.go with LoadPRD(path) and Save(path) methods
  - Added PRD.AllComplete() bool method that returns true when all stories pass
  - Added PRD.NextStory() *UserStory method that prioritizes inProgress stories, then lowest priority
  - Comprehensive unit tests covering all edge cases (empty PRD, all complete, interrupted story, priority ordering)
- Files changed:
  - internal/prd/types.go (new)
  - internal/prd/loader.go (new)
  - internal/prd/prd_test.go (new)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - NextStory() should always check for inProgress stories first (handles interrupted work)
  - Use `json:"inProgress,omitempty"` to avoid outputting false values in JSON (cleaner output)
  - Go test pattern: use t.TempDir() for test file operations - auto-cleaned up after test
  - The PRD struct returns pointers to UserStory to allow nil checks for "no story available"
---

## 2026-01-25 - US-003
- What was implemented:
  - Created internal/loop/parser.go with EventType constants (IterationStart, AssistantText, ToolStart, ToolResult, StoryStarted, StoryCompleted, Complete, MaxIterationsReached, Error)
  - Created Event struct with fields: Type, Iteration, Text, Tool, ToolInput, StoryID, Err
  - Implemented ParseLine(line string) *Event function that parses Claude's stream-json format
  - Added detection for <chief-complete/> tag to return Complete event
  - Added detection for <ralph-status> tags to track story progress
  - Extracts tool name and input from tool_use content blocks
  - Parses tool results from user messages
  - Comprehensive unit tests with real-world example stream-json lines
- Files changed:
  - internal/loop/parser.go (new)
  - internal/loop/parser_test.go (new)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Claude's stream-json output requires `--verbose` flag when using `-p` (print mode)
  - The stream-json format has three main message types: "system" (init), "assistant" (text/tool_use), "user" (tool_result)
  - Assistant messages can have multiple content blocks - parser returns the first meaningful event
  - Use json.RawMessage for nested structures to handle varying content block types
  - The extractStoryID helper uses string indices rather than regex for simplicity and performance
---

## 2026-01-25 - US-004
- What was implemented:
  - Created internal/loop/loop.go with Loop struct containing: prdPath, prompt, maxIter, iteration, events chan, claudeCmd, logFile, mu, stopped
  - Implemented Run(ctx context.Context) error that loops until complete or max iterations
  - Implemented runIteration(ctx context.Context) error that spawns Claude with flags: --dangerously-skip-permissions, -p, --output-format stream-json, --verbose
  - Streams stdout line by line, parses each line with ParseLine(), sends events to channel
  - Logs raw output to claude.log file in PRD directory
  - Implemented Stop() method that kills the Claude process and sets stopped flag
  - Checks prd.json after each iteration to detect completion using PRD.AllComplete()
  - Created comprehensive integration tests with mock data
- Files changed:
  - internal/loop/loop.go (new)
  - internal/loop/loop_test.go (new)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use bufio.Scanner with increased buffer size (1MB) for parsing large JSON lines from Claude
  - The Loop struct uses a mutex to protect claudeCmd and iteration during concurrent access
  - Use exec.CommandContext for automatic process cancellation when context is cancelled
  - Set working directory of Claude process to PRD directory so relative paths work correctly
  - The events channel has a buffer (100) to prevent blocking during high-frequency event emission
  - When testing file-based logic, use t.TempDir() for automatic cleanup

## 2026-01-25 - US-005
- What was implemented:
  - Created embed/prompt.txt with the agent prompt that instructs Claude how to work through user stories
  - Created embed/embed.go with //go:embed directive to embed the prompt at compile time
  - Implemented GetPrompt(prdPath string) function that substitutes {{PRD_PATH}} placeholder with actual path
  - Added NewLoopWithEmbeddedPrompt(prdPath, maxIter) constructor to internal/loop/loop.go
  - Created comprehensive unit tests for the embed package
  - Prompt includes all required instructions: read prd.json, select next story, set inProgress, implement, mark passes, append to progress.md, output <chief-complete/> when done
- Files changed:
  - embed/prompt.txt (new)
  - embed/embed.go (new)
  - embed/embed_test.go (new)
  - internal/loop/loop.go (modified - added NewLoopWithEmbeddedPrompt function)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Go's //go:embed directive embeds file content at compile time, making it available as a string variable
  - Use underscore import (`_ "embed"`) when using //go:embed with a package-level string variable
  - The embedded prompt uses {{PRD_PATH}} as a placeholder for string substitution with strings.ReplaceAll
  - Keep the embed package separate from internal packages to allow clean imports

## 2026-01-25 - US-006
- What was implemented:
  - Created internal/tui/app.go with main Bubble Tea model containing App struct with state, iteration tracking, PRD data
  - Created internal/tui/dashboard.go with two-panel layout (Stories list + Details panel)
  - Created internal/tui/styles.go with basic Lip Gloss style definitions and status icons
  - Stories panel shows: status icon (checkmark/dot/circle), story ID, truncated title with selection highlight
  - Details panel shows: full title, description, acceptance criteria list, priority and status
  - Header shows: "chief" branding, state indicator with colors (Ready/Running/etc), iteration count, elapsed time
  - Footer shows: keyboard shortcuts (up/k, down/j, q), current PRD name
  - Progress bar at bottom of stories panel showing completion percentage with filled/empty bars
  - Keyboard navigation: up/k moves selection up, down/j moves selection down, q quits
  - Updated cmd/chief/main.go to use the new TUI package with PRD path argument support
- Files changed:
  - internal/tui/app.go (new)
  - internal/tui/dashboard.go (new)
  - internal/tui/styles.go (new)
  - cmd/chief/main.go (modified)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - lipgloss.Color is a type, not a style - use lipgloss.NewStyle().Foreground(color) to render text with a color
  - Bubble Tea uses tea.WithAltScreen() for full-screen TUI applications
  - The App struct needs width/height from tea.WindowSizeMsg to properly render layouts
  - Use lipgloss.JoinHorizontal/JoinVertical for composing UI elements
  - Text wrapping needs to be handled manually - created wrapText helper function
  - Panel borders take up 2 characters of width (1 each side), account for this in width calculations

## 2026-01-25 - US-007
- What was implemented:
  - Added loop control methods to internal/loop/loop.go: Pause(), Resume(), IsPaused(), IsStopped(), IsRunning()
  - Modified Loop.Run() to check pause flag and stop cleanly when paused
  - Integrated Loop with App in internal/tui/app.go using context for cancellation
  - Added keyboard handlers: 's' to start, 'p' to pause, 'x' to stop
  - Added LoopEventMsg and LoopFinishedMsg custom Bubble Tea messages for loop events
  - Added activity line at bottom of dashboard showing current Claude activity
  - Context-sensitive footer shortcuts based on current state
  - Unit tests for state machine transitions in state_test.go
- Files changed:
  - internal/loop/loop.go (modified - added pause methods)
  - internal/tui/app.go (modified - added loop integration, keyboard handlers, event handling)
  - internal/tui/dashboard.go (modified - added activity line, context-sensitive shortcuts)
  - internal/tui/state_test.go (new)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use tea.Batch() to run multiple commands concurrently (e.g., runLoop + listenForEvents)
  - Custom messages (LoopEventMsg, LoopFinishedMsg) allow clean separation of loop events from UI
  - The loop's Events() channel should be read in a separate command to avoid blocking the UI
  - State transitions in Update() should return immediately with new commands for async operations
  - Context with cancel is essential for clean shutdown of the loop goroutine
  - Footer shortcuts should be context-sensitive to guide users to valid actions
---

## 2026-01-25 - US-008
- What was implemented:
  - Created internal/prd/watcher.go with Watcher struct for file watching using fsnotify
  - Watcher monitors prd.json for filesystem changes and sends WatcherEvent through a channel
  - Added hasStatusChanged() method to detect when a story's inProgress or passes field changes
  - Integrated watcher with TUI app in internal/tui/app.go
  - Added PRDUpdateMsg custom Bubble Tea message for PRD file changes
  - Watcher starts on app Init() and listens for changes concurrently
  - Handles file not found gracefully (sends error event, tries to re-watch)
  - Updates story icons in real-time when file changes
  - Created comprehensive integration tests for file watching functionality
- Files changed:
  - go.mod, go.sum (modified - added fsnotify dependency)
  - internal/prd/watcher.go (new)
  - internal/prd/watcher_test.go (new)
  - internal/tui/app.go (modified - added watcher integration)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - fsnotify requires explicit handling of file removal (try to re-add watch for potential recreation)
  - Use WatcherEvent struct with both PRD and Error fields to communicate success/failure
  - Only send PRD change events when status fields actually change (avoid noise from description edits)
  - The hasStatusChanged() method maps old stories by ID for efficient comparison
  - Watcher uses a buffered channel (10) to prevent blocking during rapid file changes
  - Always stop the watcher on app quit to release file handles
---

## 2026-01-25 - US-009
- What was implemented:
  - Expanded internal/tui/styles.go into a comprehensive styling system
  - Defined complete color palette with semantic names: PrimaryColor (cyan #00D7FF), SuccessColor (green #5AF78E), WarningColor (yellow #F3F99D), ErrorColor (red #FF5C57), MutedColor (gray #6C7086), BorderColor (dark gray #45475A)
  - Added text colors (TextColor, TextMutedColor, TextBrightColor) and background colors (BgColor, BgSelectedColor, BgHighlightColor)
  - Created organized style categories: Header styles, Footer styles, Panel styles, Selection styles, Status badge styles, Title/label styles, Progress bar styles, Activity line styles, Divider styles
  - Added state-specific styles: StateReadyStyle, StateRunningStyle, StatePausedStyle, StateStoppedStyle, StateCompleteStyle, StateErrorStyle
  - Added helper functions: GetStateStyle(state) and GetActivityStyle(state) for consistent state rendering
  - Added IconPaused constant and statusPausedStyle for paused state (yellow)
  - Updated dashboard.go to use centralized styling system throughout (removed inline style definitions)
  - Maintained backward compatibility with lowercase aliases for existing code
- Files changed:
  - internal/tui/styles.go (modified - expanded from 77 to 218 lines)
  - internal/tui/dashboard.go (modified - use centralized styles)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Organize styles into logical categories (header, footer, panel, status, etc.) for maintainability
  - Export styles with PascalCase and keep lowercase aliases for backward compatibility
  - Create helper functions (GetStateStyle, GetActivityStyle) to encapsulate state-to-style mappings
  - Use semantic color names (Primary, Success, Warning, Error) rather than color names (Cyan, Green, Yellow, Red)
  - Keep divider/border styles centralized to ensure consistent visual separators throughout the app

## 2026-01-25 - US-010
- What was implemented:
  - Created internal/tui/log.go with LogViewer struct and LogEntry type
  - Added scrollable viewport with line-by-line rendering
  - Toggle with 't' key from dashboard, returns to dashboard with 't'
  - Assistant text rendered as regular paragraphs with word wrapping
  - Tool calls displayed as styled cards (box with icon and tool name)
  - Tool results shown as compact lines with arrow indicator
  - Story markers and completion messages have special styling
  - Vim-style scrolling: j/k (line), Ctrl+D/U (page), g/G (top/bottom)
  - Auto-scroll enabled by default, disabled when user scrolls up manually
  - Blinking cursor indicator shown at bottom when auto-scrolling and streaming
  - Footer shows context-sensitive shortcuts (log view vs dashboard view)
  - Added ViewMode type to App for switching between views
  - Updated handleLoopEvent to add events to log viewer
- Files changed:
  - internal/tui/log.go (new - LogViewer, LogEntry, scrolling, rendering)
  - internal/tui/app.go (modified - ViewMode, log viewer integration, key handlers)
  - internal/tui/dashboard.go (modified - renderLogView, renderLogHeader, updated footer)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use line-based rendering ([]string) for scrollable content instead of calculating heights dynamically
  - Auto-scroll behavior: track with boolean, disable on scroll up, re-enable at bottom
  - Tool cards use Unicode box drawing (╭╮╰╯│─) for clean borders
  - Blink effect with lipgloss.Blink(true) for cursor indicators
  - ViewMode enum pattern works well for multi-view TUI applications
  - Key handlers should check viewMode first for view-specific behavior
---

## 2026-01-25 - US-011
- What was implemented:
  - Created internal/tui/picker.go with PRDPicker struct and PRDEntry type
  - Modal overlay that lists all PRDs from .chief/prds/ directory
  - Each entry shows: name, progress bar (█/░), completion count, status indicators (● for in-progress, ✓ for complete)
  - Current PRD highlighted with green bullet indicator
  - Keyboard navigation: up/k, down/j, Enter to select, Esc/l to close
  - 'n' key enters input mode for creating new PRD with name validation (alphanumeric, -, _)
  - Input mode with blinking cursor and visual feedback
  - Integrated with App: added ViewPicker mode, handlePickerKeys(), switchToPRD() methods
  - 'l' key toggle from dashboard or log view opens picker
  - Footer shortcuts updated to show 'l: prds' option
- Files changed:
  - internal/tui/picker.go (new - PRDPicker, PRDEntry, Refresh, keyboard handling, rendering)
  - internal/tui/app.go (modified - ViewPicker mode, picker integration, switchToPRD)
  - internal/tui/dashboard.go (modified - added 'l: prds' to footer shortcuts)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Modal overlays can be centered using padding calculations based on terminal dimensions
  - Input mode requires separate key handling path (check IsInputMode() before processing normal keys)
  - PRD switching requires stopping current loop, watcher, and reinitializing state cleanly
  - Use os.ReadDir to list directories, check IsDir() to filter for subdirectories only
  - Character validation for input can be done inline without regex (simpler, faster)
  - baseDir calculation: parse the prdPath to extract parent of .chief/prds/name/
---

## 2026-01-25 - US-012
- What was implemented:
  - Created internal/loop/manager.go with Manager struct for parallel PRD execution
  - LoopInstance struct tracks per-PRD state (Name, PRDPath, Loop, State, Iteration, StartTime, Error)
  - LoopState enum: LoopStateReady, LoopStateRunning, LoopStatePaused, LoopStateStopped, LoopStateComplete, LoopStateError
  - Manager methods: Register, Unregister, Start, Stop, Pause, GetState, GetInstance, GetAllInstances, GetRunningPRDs, GetRunningCount, StopAll
  - ManagerEvent struct for forwarding events from any managed loop (includes PRDName)
  - SetCompletionCallback for triggering notifications when any PRD completes
  - Updated PRDPicker to show real-time loop status with visual indicators (▶ for running with iteration count, ⏸ for paused, ✓ for complete, ✗ for error, ■ for stopped)
  - Added s/p/x controls in picker for selected PRD (context-sensitive footer shortcuts)
  - Updated App to use Manager instead of single Loop instance
  - Refactored startLoop/pauseLoop/stopLoop to work with specific PRD names
  - switchToPRD now preserves running loops (just switches the view)
  - Header shows running PRDs indicator (▶ +N PRDs when multiple running)
  - Resource cleanup: stopAllLoops() called on quit, uses Manager.StopAll() which waits for all loops
  - Comprehensive unit tests for Manager (concurrent access, state transitions, callbacks)
- Files changed:
  - internal/loop/manager.go (new)
  - internal/loop/manager_test.go (new)
  - internal/tui/app.go (modified - replaced single loop with manager, added per-PRD methods)
  - internal/tui/dashboard.go (modified - added renderRunningIndicator)
  - internal/tui/picker.go (modified - added LoopState/Iteration fields, manager integration, state indicators)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Manager pattern: centralize multi-instance management with a map of instances protected by RWMutex
  - Each loop instance needs its own context for cancellation - store in the instance struct
  - Use sync.WaitGroup to wait for all goroutines to complete on shutdown
  - PRD switching should NOT stop the running loop - just change which one is being viewed
  - State synchronization: when switching PRDs, read state from manager to show correct UI
  - Manager events need PRDName to distinguish which PRD the event is from
  - Loop state indicators should be compact in picker (emoji + iteration count fits well)
  - Context-sensitive shortcuts in modals improve usability (show start/pause/stop based on selected item's state)
---

## 2026-01-25 - US-013
- What was implemented:
  - Created internal/tui/help.go with HelpOverlay struct, ShortcutCategory, and Shortcut types
  - Implemented ? key toggle from any view (Dashboard, Log, Picker)
  - Display shortcuts organized by categories: Loop Control, Views, Navigation, Scrolling, General
  - Context-aware shortcuts: shows different categories based on current view mode
  - Esc or ? closes the overlay, returns to previous view
  - Centered modal with rounded border and styled header/footer
  - Added ViewHelp mode and previousViewMode field to track view to return to
  - Updated footer in all views to show ?: help shortcut
- Files changed:
  - internal/tui/help.go (new - HelpOverlay, ShortcutCategory, Shortcut, GetCategories, Render)
  - internal/tui/app.go (modified - ViewHelp mode, helpOverlay integration, ? key handling)
  - internal/tui/dashboard.go (modified - added ?: help to footer shortcuts)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Modal overlays need to remember previous view to return to (use previousViewMode pattern)
  - Handle overlay key first before view-specific key handling to ensure it works from any view
  - Two-column layout for shortcuts: split categories using (len+1)/2 for balanced columns
  - Help context should match the view it was opened from, not the current ViewHelp mode

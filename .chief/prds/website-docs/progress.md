## Codebase Patterns
- Global Vue components registered via `app.component()` in `enhanceApp` can be used directly in markdown files without imports
- VitePress docs live in `/docs` directory with `.vitepress/config.ts` for configuration
- Use `npm run docs:dev` to start dev server, `npm run docs:build` for production build
- Base URL is `/chief/` for GitHub Pages project site
- Custom theme lives in `docs/.vitepress/theme/` with `index.ts` extending DefaultTheme
- Vue components for theme go in `docs/.vitepress/theme/components/` directory
- Custom layouts extend DefaultTheme.Layout and can use slots like `#home-hero-before`
- Links in Vue components must include base path (e.g., `/chief/guide/` not `/guide/`)
- Tailwind CSS v4 uses `@import "tailwindcss"` directive (not v3's `@tailwind` directives)
- Tailwind v4 plugin is configured via VitePress's `vite.plugins` option in config.ts
- Tokyo Night color palette defined in `tailwind.css` with both Tailwind v4 `@theme` and VitePress CSS variables
- Site is forced dark mode via `appearance: 'force-dark'` in config.ts
- Code blocks use Shiki's `tokyo-night` theme via `markdown.theme` in config.ts
- Links in markdown files should NOT include base path (use `/guide/quick-start` not `/chief/guide/quick-start`)
- Links in Vue components MUST include base path (use `/chief/guide/quick-start` not `/guide/quick-start`)
- Use `transformPageData` in config.ts to inject build-time data into pages via `pageData.frontmatter.head` script tags
- The `#doc-before` slot in DefaultTheme.Layout only renders on doc pages, not on home/landing pages

## 2026-01-28 - US-001
- **What was implemented**: VitePress project scaffolded in /docs directory
- **Files changed**:
  - `.gitignore` - added node_modules and VitePress build artifacts
  - `docs/package.json` - created with dev/build/preview scripts
  - `docs/package-lock.json` - dependency lockfile
  - `docs/.vitepress/config.ts` - site configuration with title "Chief", tagline "Autonomous PRD Agent", base URL `/chief/`
  - `docs/index.md` - landing page with hero layout
  - `docs/guide/index.md` - placeholder getting started page
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - VitePress v1.6.x uses Vite under the hood, configuration is in `.vitepress/config.ts`
  - The `base` option in config must match GitHub Pages project path (e.g., `/chief/`)
  - VitePress creates `.vitepress/cache/` and `.vitepress/dist/` directories that should be gitignored
  - Dev server runs on port 5173 by default

## 2026-01-28 - US-002
- **What was implemented**: Tailwind CSS v4 integration with VitePress
- **Files changed**:
  - `docs/package.json` - added tailwindcss and @tailwindcss/vite dependencies
  - `docs/package-lock.json` - updated lockfile with new dependencies
  - `docs/.vitepress/config.ts` - added Tailwind v4 Vite plugin via `vite.plugins` option
  - `docs/.vitepress/theme/index.ts` - custom theme extending DefaultTheme and importing tailwind.css
  - `docs/.vitepress/theme/tailwind.css` - CSS file with `@import "tailwindcss"` directive
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Tailwind CSS v4 uses `@import "tailwindcss"` directive instead of v3's `@tailwind base/components/utilities`
  - VitePress custom themes go in `.vitepress/theme/` with `index.ts` as entry point
  - The theme must re-export DefaultTheme to preserve VitePress default styling
  - Vite plugins are added to VitePress via the `vite` config option in `.vitepress/config.ts`
  - Tailwind v4 is purely CSS-based with no separate config file needed for basic setup
---

## 2026-01-28 - US-003
- **What was implemented**: Tokyo Night dark theme for the documentation site
- **Files changed**:
  - `docs/.vitepress/config.ts` - added `appearance: 'force-dark'` and `markdown.theme: 'tokyo-night'` for code blocks
  - `docs/.vitepress/theme/tailwind.css` - extensive Tokyo Night color palette and VitePress CSS variable overrides
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - VitePress uses `appearance: 'force-dark'` to force dark mode and hide the theme toggle
  - Shiki (VitePress's syntax highlighter) has built-in `tokyo-night` theme - just set `markdown.theme: 'tokyo-night'`
  - VitePress CSS variables are organized by category: `--vp-c-brand-*`, `--vp-c-bg-*`, `--vp-c-text-*`, etc.
  - Tailwind v4 uses `@theme` directive to define custom color utilities (e.g., `--color-tokyo-bg` becomes `bg-tokyo-bg`)
  - VitePress class names like `.VPSidebar`, `.VPNav`, `.VPContent` can be styled directly
  - Custom block (tip, warning, danger) colors use `--vp-c-tip-*`, `--vp-c-warning-*`, `--vp-c-danger-*` variables
  - Force dark mode for non-.dark html with duplicate CSS variables to prevent flash of light theme

## 2026-01-28 - US-004
- **What was implemented**: Landing page hero section with animated terminal
- **Files changed**:
  - `docs/.vitepress/theme/components/Hero.vue` - new custom Hero component with headline, terminal animation, install command, and CTA buttons
  - `docs/.vitepress/theme/HomeLayout.vue` - custom layout that hides default VitePress hero and uses custom Hero component
  - `docs/.vitepress/theme/index.ts` - updated to use HomeLayout as the main layout
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - VitePress allows custom layouts via named slots like `#home-hero-before`, `#home-hero-info`, etc.
  - To completely replace the default hero, use a custom Layout component that extends DefaultTheme.Layout
  - Hide default VitePress hero with `.VPHome .VPHero { display: none !important; }`
  - CSS animations with `animation-delay` can create sequenced typing/fadeIn effects for terminal output
  - Vue components in VitePress theme go in `.vitepress/theme/components/` directory
  - Links in Vue components should use the full base path (e.g., `/chief/guide/` not `/guide/`)
---

  - `docs/.vitepress/theme/HomeLayout.vue` - updated to include HowItWorks component after Hero
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Landing page sections are added to HomeLayout via the `#home-hero-before` slot after other components
  - Tokyo Night color variables can be used directly in component styles (e.g., `#7aa2f7` for accent, `#bb9af7` for purple, `#9ece6a` for green)
  - SVG icons from Feather Icons work well for step illustrations
  - Flexbox with `flex-direction: column` on mobile and row on desktop handles responsive step layouts
  - Step connectors (arrows) should rotate 90 degrees on mobile to maintain visual flow

  - `docs/.vitepress/theme/HomeLayout.vue` - updated to include Features component after HowItWorks
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - CSS Grid with `grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr)` creates a 2-column layout that gracefully collapses to 1 column on mobile
  - Different hover border colors for each card can be achieved with `:nth-child(n)` selectors
  - Use `rgba()` for semi-transparent background colors on feature icons (e.g., `rgba(122, 162, 247, 0.1)`)
  - Alternate section backgrounds between `#1a1b26` and `#16161e` for visual separation
  - The cyan color for Tokyo Night is `#7dcfff` (useful for UI/TUI related icons)
---

## 2026-01-28 - US-007
- **What was implemented**: Landing page footer with CTA section
- **Files changed**:
  - `docs/.vitepress/theme/components/Footer.vue` - new footer component with "Ready to automate your PRDs?" CTA, links to quick start guide and GitHub, and copyright notice

- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Footer sections can be placed in the `#home-hero-before` slot along with other landing page sections
  - Use `border-top` to visually separate footer from content above
  - CTA buttons follow same styling pattern as Hero: primary (filled) and secondary (outlined)
  - Dynamic year in copyright: `{{ new Date().getFullYear() }}` works in Vue template
  - Footer uses darker `#16161e` background to contrast with `#1a1b26` features section above
---

## 2026-01-28 - US-008

## 2026-01-28 - US-009
- **What was implemented**: Comprehensive Quick Start guide with all installation options and step-by-step instructions
- **Files changed**:
  - `docs/guide/quick-start.md` - expanded from placeholder to full guide with prerequisites, installation options (Homebrew, install script, from source), step-by-step workflow, TUI explanation with keyboard controls, and next steps links
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - VitePress `::: code-group` syntax creates tabbed code blocks for showing multiple installation options
  - Tables in markdown work well for keyboard shortcuts reference (pipe-separated columns with header row)
  - VitePress custom blocks `::: tip`, `::: info`, `::: warning` are useful for highlighting prerequisites and notes
  - Quick start guides should focus on "get running fast" with links to deeper docs, not exhaustive detail
---

## 2026-01-28 - US-010
- **What was implemented**: Detailed installation guide with all platform coverage
- **Files changed**:
  - `docs/guide/installation.md` - expanded from basic guide to comprehensive installation reference with prerequisites at top, Homebrew with update instructions, install script options table, complete platform matrix, platform-specific code tabs for manual download, building from source with version embedding, and thorough verification section

---

## 2026-01-28 - US-014
- **What was implemented**: Comprehensive PRD Format Reference page with full documentation of both `prd.md` and `prd.json` formats
- **Files changed**:
  - `docs/concepts/prd-format.md` - expanded from basic placeholder to comprehensive reference with:
    - Detailed `prd.md` guidance with what to include and a full example
    - Complete `prd.json` schema documentation with top-level, settings, and UserStory field tables
    - Story selection logic explanation with priority walkthrough table and `inProgress` behavior
    - Fully annotated example PRD with comments explaining every field
    - Best practices section: specific acceptance criteria, keeping stories small, ordering by dependency, consistent IDs, giving Claude context
    - "What's Next" navigation links
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - JSON doesn't support comments, so annotated examples need an `::: info` callout explaining annotations are for illustration only
  - Good/bad comparison code blocks are effective for showing best practices (use `// ✓ Good` and `// ✗ Bad` prefixes)
  - Tables with Story/Priority/Passes/Selected columns are effective for explaining selection logic
  - The PRD schema reference page (`/reference/prd-schema`) already has TypeScript interfaces — the concepts page should focus on practical usage, not duplicate type definitions
---

## 2026-01-28 - US-016
- **What was implemented**: Verified existing Troubleshooting Guide meets all acceptance criteria
- **Files changed**:
  - `docs/troubleshooting/common-issues.md` - already had comprehensive content from US-008 covering all 6 required issues (Claude not found, Permission denied, No sound on completion, PRD not updating, Loop not progressing, Max iterations reached) plus 2 additional issues (No PRD Found, Invalid JSON)
  - `.chief/prds/website-docs/prd.json` - marked US-016 as passes: true
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Some stories may already be implemented by earlier stories that created placeholder pages with full content (US-008 created all doc pages with initial content)
  - Always verify the build passes even when no new content is added — the build check is the quality gate
  - The troubleshooting page uses a consistent Symptom/Cause/Solution pattern with code examples, which is a good format for debugging guides
---

## 2026-01-28 - US-017
- **What was implemented**: LLM Actions Vue component with dropdown menu for copying page markdown and opening in ChatGPT/Claude
- **Files changed**:
  - `docs/.vitepress/theme/components/LlmActions.vue` - new component with dropdown menu containing "Copy as Markdown", "Open in ChatGPT", and "Open in Claude" actions
  - `docs/.vitepress/config.ts` - added `transformPageData` hook to inject raw markdown content into `window.__DOC_RAW` via head script tag
  - `docs/.vitepress/theme/HomeLayout.vue` - integrated LlmActions component into `#doc-before` slot so it appears on doc pages only (not landing page)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - VitePress `transformPageData` hook runs at build time and can inject scripts via `pageData.frontmatter.head` push
  - Use `siteConfig.srcDir` (not `siteConfig.root`) to construct file paths for reading markdown source in transformers
  - The `#doc-before` slot in DefaultTheme.Layout renders content above doc pages only — it does not appear on home layout pages
  - `JSON.stringify()` is essential for safely embedding raw markdown in a `<script>` tag (handles newlines, quotes, etc.)
  - Click-outside pattern for dropdowns: add `document.addEventListener('click', handler)` in `onMounted` and clean up in `onUnmounted`
  - ChatGPT URL format: `https://chatgpt.com/?q=<encoded>`, Claude URL format: `https://claude.ai/new?q=<encoded>`
---

## 2026-01-28 - US-018
- **What was implemented**: VitePress local search enabled via built-in search provider

  - `docs/.vitepress/config.ts` - added `search: { provider: 'local' }` to `themeConfig`
  - `.chief/prds/website-docs/prd.json` - marked US-018 as passes: true
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - VitePress built-in local search (`provider: 'local'`) covers all common search needs: `/` key trigger, search icon in nav bar, page titles and content previews, and keyboard navigation — no additional configuration needed
  - The search configuration goes in `themeConfig.search`, not at the top-level config
  - No additional packages needed — local search is built into VitePress core
---

## 2026-01-28 - US-019
- **What was implemented**: Screenshot and recording placeholder components with placeholders on doc pages and images directory
- **Files changed**:

  - `docs/reference/cli.md` - added TUI log view placeholder in keyboard shortcuts section
  - `docs/public/images/README.md` - created with list of required screenshots, recording specs, and image guidelines
  - `.chief/prds/website-docs/prd.json` - marked US-019 as passes: true
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - VitePress global components are registered in `enhanceApp({ app })` in the theme's `index.ts` using `app.component()`
  - Global components can be used directly in markdown files without imports (e.g., `<PlaceholderImage label="..." />`)
  - The `docs/public/` directory serves static assets at the site root (e.g., `docs/public/images/foo.png` → `/chief/images/foo.png`)
  - Vue component props with default values use `defineProps<{}>()` with optional types (e.g., `width?: string`)
---

## 2026-01-28 - US-020
- **What was implemented**: GitHub Actions workflow for automatic deployment to GitHub Pages
- **Files changed**:
  - `.github/workflows/docs.yml` - new workflow file that builds VitePress site and deploys to GitHub Pages on push to main
  - `.chief/prds/website-docs/prd.json` - marked US-020 as passes: true
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - GitHub Pages deployment uses a two-job pipeline: `build` (upload artifact) and `deploy` (deploy pages)
  - `actions/configure-pages@v5`, `actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3`, and `actions/deploy-pages@v4` are the current recommended actions
  - The workflow needs `permissions: pages: write, id-token: write, contents: read` for Pages deployment
  - `concurrency` group with `cancel-in-progress: false` prevents concurrent deployments from conflicting
  - `workflow_dispatch` trigger allows manual deployment without a code push
  - The `paths` filter on push trigger limits builds to changes in `docs/` or the workflow file itself
  - npm ci with `cache-dependency-path` pointing to `docs/package-lock.json` enables dependency caching
---

## 2026-01-28 - US-021

    - `docs/index.md`, `docs/guide/index.md`, `docs/guide/quick-start.md`, `docs/guide/installation.md`
    - `docs/concepts/how-it-works.md`, `docs/concepts/ralph-loop.md`, `docs/concepts/prd-format.md`, `docs/concepts/chief-directory.md`
    - `docs/reference/cli.md`, `docs/reference/configuration.md`, `docs/reference/prd-schema.md`
    - `docs/troubleshooting/common-issues.md`, `docs/troubleshooting/faq.md`
  - `.chief/prds/website-docs/prd.json` - marked US-021 as passes: true
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - VitePress auto-generates `<meta name="description">` from the page's frontmatter `description` or site-level `description` config
  - Don't put explicit `<meta name="description">` in the `head` array — it will override per-page frontmatter descriptions
  - ImageMagick can create simple OG images: `magick -size 1200x630 xc:'#color' -font "Helvetica-Bold" -pointsize 72 -fill '#color' -gravity center -annotate +0+0 'Text' output.png`
  - Favicon can be created with ImageMagick: `magick -size 128x128 xc:'#bg' ... -resize 32x32 favicon.ico`
  - OG image URL must be absolute (e.g., `https://minicodemonkey.github.io/chief/images/og-default.png`)
  - VitePress frontmatter `description` appears as `<meta name="description">` in the rendered HTML
---

## 2026-01-28 - US-022
- **What was implemented**: Mobile responsiveness verification and improvements across the site
- **Files changed**:
  - `docs/.vitepress/theme/tailwind.css` - added comprehensive mobile CSS including:
    - Code blocks with horizontal scroll (`overflow-x: auto`, `-webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch`)
    - Tables with horizontal scroll wrapper
    - Touch targets minimum 44px height for interactive elements (sidebar links, nav items, search buttons)
    - Font size adjustments for code and tables at 768px and 420px breakpoints
    - Tighter spacing at 375px (420px) breakpoint
  - `docs/.vitepress/theme/components/Hero.vue` - added 375px (420px) breakpoint with:
    - Smaller hero headline and subheadline font sizes
    - Smaller terminal font size and padding
    - Touch target minimum height (44px) for buttons and copy button
  - `.chief/prds/website-docs/prd.json` - marked US-022 as passes: true
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - VitePress navigation automatically collapses to hamburger menu on mobile — no custom implementation needed
  - Touch targets should be minimum 44px for accessibility (Apple/Google HIG recommendation)
  - Use `-webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch` for smooth momentum scrolling on iOS
  - Tables with `display: block; overflow-x: auto` allow horizontal scrolling while preserving table structure
  - Landing page components (Hero, HowItWorks, Features, Footer) already had 640px breakpoints from initial implementation — just needed to add 375px/420px for very small screens
  - VitePress uses 768px as the mobile breakpoint for sidebar collapse
